# CovidCheck
Checks the website of my Covid 19 test's laboratory for result

The test laboratory is located in Freiburg / Germany and I guess
its test result website's HTML structure is completely unique.

Usage
-----

Run `./check.sh` to see usage.

You should have a Selenium server running on
localhost bound to port 4444 and a Chrome installation.

You can use docker for that, e.g. https://hub.docker.com/r/yukinying/chrome-headless-browser-selenium
which is bundled with the Selenium server.
